<h1>AddBuy for YNAB</h1>

<h2>Deactivated</h2>
Hi,<br>
<br>
AddBuy for YNAB is no longer functioning as I do not currently have an active YNAB account and therefore the app's key won't be accepted. This may change down the road but because I was no longer using the service, I was unable to justify the continuing cost. Download count was very modest and so I do not see this as being an inconvenience to users, as those that did install it would have recognized the app as one that is pre-release (versions 0.x etc).<br>
<br>
Would like to update the app to something more well-rounded and complete at some point and I also may look at developing a separate version that works with a different service.<br>
<br>
Thanks for checking out the app,<br>
Michael

Version 0.2.1

A simple transaction-entry app for YNAB on Sailfish OS. Saves same-day purchases and displays recent transactions.

Privacy Policy: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/W6aKgySZ

Access key can be removed on the Settings page. Note: If the user selected the 'Keep me logged in' option when initially authorizing the app, they'll need to deauthorize from their YNAB account settings to stop the app from automatically logging back in.

Requires a YNAB account (paid service, free trial available).

<h3>Rationale</h3>

- Android version of YNAB is incompatible with Alien Dalvik on Sony Xperia X.
- Overall positive to have more native SFOS apps.
- Useful also in learning my way around Qt/QML programming.

<h3>Features</h3>

- Add same-day purchases and inflow transactions to your account(s).
- Check recent transactions.
- View read-only budget numbers.
- Load any two chosen account or category balances on the app cover.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

- User will need to reauthorize every two hours. Re-authorization when going to Recent Transactions does not always work and can result in a blank page. Settings page 'Forget Access Key' option or quitting and reopening the app are alternatives.
- When choosing a category for a transaction, as long as the payee already exists (and was assigned a category), leaving the field as Default will assign the last category used with that payee. If entering a new payee, user will need to select a category to avoid leaving this field empty when saving.
